namely, preventing Iraq from becoming what Afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the Middle East, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home', 'There is no reason to believe that more of the same will achieve these objectives in Iraq', ' It’s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding American forces will only relieve the Iraqis from doing more on their own', ' Moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the Iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war', ' The American soldiers I met when I traveled to Iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question', ' They have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in Iraq', 'I have long said that the only solution in Iraq is a political one', ' To reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in Iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end', ' Our best hope for success is to use the tools we have ? military, financial, diplomatic ? to pressure the Iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control', 'The first part of this strategy begins by exerting the greatest leverage we have on the Iraqi government ? a phased redeployment of U', ' troops from Iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months', ' For only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the Iraqi factions that the U', ' is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ? that it will be up to them to form a viable government that can effectively run and secure Iraq', ' The President should announce to the Iraqi people that our policy will include a gradual and substantial reduction in U', ' When possible, this should be done in consultation with the Iraqi government ? but it should not depend on Iraqi approval', ' The redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in Iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels', 'Drawing down our troops in Iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to Northern Iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force', ' This force could help prevent the conflict in Iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in Northern Iraq, reassure allies in the Gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al Qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region', ' The President’s decision to go to war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control', ' By redeploying from Iraq to Afghanistan, we will answer NATO’s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism', ' troops remaining in Iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and American enclaves like the Green Zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists', ' force might remain in Iraq for a more extended period of time', ' commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ? in a public and unambiguous way ? for such continued support', ' We would make clear in such a scenario that the United States would not be maintaining permanent military bases in Iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the Iraqi state and further polarization of Iraqi society', 'The second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the Iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ? especially special forces ? who are deployed with Iraqi as units advisers', ' personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of Iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of Iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents', ' strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in Iraq', ' In the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in Iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified Iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that U', 'Of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the Iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police', ' We can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the Iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government', 'The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement', 'So far, Congress has given the Administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in Iraq', ' Today, the Iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the Iraqi people or stabilize the country', 'We need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put Iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas', ' But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement', 'Finally, we have to realize that the entire Middle East has an enormous stake in the outcome of Iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution', ' But neither Iran nor Syria want to see a security vacuum in Iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ? and within their own countries', 'And so I firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the Iraqis, Saudis, Iranians, Syrians, the Turks, Jordanians, the British and others', ' The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution', 'Make no mistake ? if the Iranians and Syrians think they can use Iraq as another Afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack Israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken', ' As we change strategy in Iraq, we should also think about what Iraq has taught us about America’s strategy in the wider struggle against rogue threats and international terrorism', 'Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation', ' Much has been written about how the military invasion of Iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after Baghdad fell', 'We need to keep these lessons in mind as we think about the broader threats America now faces ?

war in Iraq has had disastrous consequences for Afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce Taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control', ' Instead of consolidating the gains made by the Karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos', ' commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among Iraqi factions; if the Iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the Iraqi government asked us ? in a public and unambiguous way ? for such continued support', 'The third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in Iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement', 'This must end in the next session of Congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war', ' But we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of Iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement', ' The goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of Iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various Iraqi factions towards a political solution', 'Many who supported the original decision to go to war in Iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation', ' But I have long believed it has also been a failure of conception ? that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided', ' And so going forward, I believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century', 'The second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success', 'The National Intelligence Estimate, which details how we’re creating more terrorists in Iraq than we’re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism', \" Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change\", \"I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus\", 'In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government', ' And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win', ' To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty', 'But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict', 'It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice', ' Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor', ' We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future', 'Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare', '\"Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U', 'Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures', \" For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow\", ' In the face of war, you believe there can be peace', \"All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can\", \"For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight\", ' We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world', 'But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq', ' Most of you know I opposed this war from the start', \" It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war\", 'Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most', \" It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not\", 'We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more', \"Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill\", \"It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road\", \"Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it\", 'For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face', \"And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war\", 'I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan', ' And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain', 'Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend']
